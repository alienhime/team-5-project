    <h2>Santa Cruz (general)</h2>
    <h3>How does this affect Santa Cruz?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>There will be an increased incidence of severe flooding near the riverbank (including downtown and beach flat neighborhoods).</li>
      <li>Beaches will progressively get smaller and smaller.</li>
      <li>Oceans can be anywhere from three - six feet higher by the next century.</li>
      <li>Over 30 access points within city limits are exposed and vulnerable to sea level rise, and approximately 20 surf breaks, located within city limits, are projected to be impacted by rising sea levels.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Cowell Beach is threatened by accelerated loss of sand</li>
          <li>West Cliff by loss of surf quality and accelerated loss of cliffs</li>
          <li>East Cliff by accelerated loss of cliffs and loss of coastal access point</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Sea level rise will worsen/aggravate coastal storm events, cliff erosion, and flooding — drought, ocean acidification, extreme storms, extreme heat, saltwater intrusion, and increased risk of wildfire.</li>
      <li>Sea level rise <i>may</i> currently contribute to rising and fluctuating groundwater at the Wastewater Treatment Facility.</li>
      <li>Decrease in sand supply on beaches.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div id="west_cliff">
    <h2>West Cliff</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Houses along West Cliff Drive between Woodrow Avenue and Lighthouse Field were identified as vulnerable to coastal erosion by the year 2100.</li>
      <li>Because of erosion and anticipated sea level rise, the cliffs on West Cliff Drive have progressively become more unstable as it becomes worn down, caves become deepened, and more sinkholes are created.</li>
      <li>West Cliff’s pocket beaches are predicted to cease to exist by the year 2060 due to rising tides and armoring the coast.</li>
      <ul><li>This means less tourism.</li></ul>
    </ul>
