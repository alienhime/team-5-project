   <div id="box-one">
     <p>1. What is one adaptation strategy the City of Santa Cruz implemented in response to rising sea levels?</p>
     <button onclick ="myFunction()" id="uno">Repairng bridges that have been damaged by and/or exacerbated any flooding
     in the past.</button>
     <button onclick ="yourFunction()" id ="dos">Identify priority areas for managed retreat, such as relocating roads and infrastructre</button>
   </div>
   <p id="test" style="display: none">That is correct! In the Climate Adaptation Plan Update 2018-2022, it is said bridge repairments were one of the
   adaptations the city has already initiated.</p>
   <p id="testtwo" style="display: none">That is incorrect. As of 2017, this aspect was still in the planning phase, however, it is regarded as a high priority in
     response to the issue of rising levels as well as sea erosion.</p>




   <div id="box-two">
     <p>2. West Cliff Drive is becoming increasingly vulnerable to cliff erosion. One solution
     Santa Cruz county has initated is setting up rip raps which entail long term stability. </p>
     <button onclick= "hisFunction()" id="tres">True</button>
     <button onclick ="herFunction()" id ="cuatro">False</button>
   </div>
   <p id="operation" style="display: none">That is incorrect. An article by Santa Cruz Sentinel refers to this as a
     "bandaid solution" and that by 2060, West Cliff's beaches will be reclaimed to the sea as a consequce of armoring the coast. </p>
   <p id="operationtwo" style="display: none">That is correct! West Wise suggests there needs to be a conversation on the state of the coast as rip raps
     cover a large amount the beach, limiting access. Susan Craig, the commission's Central Coast district manager believes there is perhaps a "more nuanced
     approach to take over time."</p>






   <div id="box-three">
   <p>3. In Santa Cruz, sea levels are projected to rise 4 inches by 2030, 28 by 2060 and 68 by 2100. Is
     it possible that these changes can be reversed?</p>
   <button onclick= "theirFunction()"id="cinco">Yes</button>
   <button onclick= "ourFunction()" id ="seis">No</button>
   </div>
   <p id="procedure" style="display: none">That is correct! These effects cannot be reversed.
  To prepare for these changes, Resilient Coast Santa Cruz proposes to limit development in flood zones, having safer codes for coastal construction,
 and moving roads away form vulnerable areas</p>
   <p id="proceduretwo" style="display: none">Unfortunately, this is not the case. However, it is still best to prepare. As West Wise states on the issue of West Cliff, instead of
   waiting until 2050 to build a seawall, it's better to observe the physical changes now to see how much the cliffs have eroded, and make changes from there. </p>
